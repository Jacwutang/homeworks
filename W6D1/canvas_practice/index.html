<!-- Take a look at the index.html that has been provided for you. Notice that there is a canvas element that has been included in the body. This is the element that we will be working with. By default, the canvas element has a width of 300px and a height of 150px.

In the practice.js file, we have added an event listener that waits for the document to be loaded before looking for the canvas element.

Create a 2D rendering context:

Grab the canvas element by id and save it to a variable
Set the height and width attributes of the canvas to 500
Call getContext on the canvas with '2d' as an argument and save the return value as ctx
You will be setting attributes and calling methods on ctx for the rest of this exercise -->
